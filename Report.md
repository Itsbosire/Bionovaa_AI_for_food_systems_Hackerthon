# Mkulima Link Kenya – Project Report

## 1. Introduction

Mkulima Link Kenya is an agricultural support application designed to improve productivity, resilience, and market access for smallholder farmers in Kenya. The platform leverages modern digital tools—including AI image analysis, real-time weather data, and a community knowledge hub—to empower farmers with actionable information.

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers form the backbone of Kenya’s food system, yet many lack access to timely agricultural information, climate forecasts, or fair market opportunities.  
**Key challenges include:**

- Limited access to trusted weather forecasts  
- Difficulty identifying crop diseases early  
- Unreliable or exploitative market pricing  
- Poor access to agricultural experts  
- Low digital literacy in rural communities  

These gaps hinder adaptation to climate change and reduce overall productivity and income.

## 3. Project Objectives

The main goals of the Mkulima Link Kenya app are to:

- Provide farmers with real-time, location-specific weather updates  
- Detect crop diseases using AI image recognition  
- Enable transparency in market prices across Kenya  
- Connect farmers with buyers, experts, and peer communities  
- Provide offline access through USSD for underserved regions  

## 4. Proposed Solution

Mkulima Link Kenya is a mobile-first platform designed with Kenyan farmers in mind. The solution integrates:

### **4.1 AI Disease Detection**

Farmers can take a photo of an affected plant and receive:

- Disease identification  
- Severity assessment  
- Recommended actions or treatments  

### **4.2 Weather Information**

- Daily and weekly forecasts  
- Rainfall predictions  
- Alerts for extreme conditions  
- Accessible via app and USSD  

### **4.3 Market Information**

Provides:

- Up-to-date crop and livestock prices  
- County-level market comparison  
- Direct link to verified buyers  

### **4.4 Community Forum**

A space where:

- Farmers ask questions  
- Experts provide guidance  
- Members share experiences and resources  

## 5. Prototype Development

The interactive prototype was designed using **Figma**, incorporating both low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity UI screens.  
A functional prototype demo was recorded using **Loom**.
